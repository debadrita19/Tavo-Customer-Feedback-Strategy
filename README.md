# Enhancing Customer Feedback Strategy for TAVO Sleep 🛌📲

This repository contains my final project for the **Entrepreneurship - New Venture Creation (BADM 446)** course, completed in collaboration with the sleep-tech startup [TAVO Sleep](https://www.tavosleep.com/). The focus was on designing a structured, actionable customer feedback strategy to help TAVO improve customer satisfaction, user engagement, and product development.

## 🚀 About TAVO Sleep

## 🎯 Project Objective

> **Goal:** Enhance TAVO's relationship with its customers by designing and deploying a direct feedback mechanism, going beyond generic app store reviews.

The primary deliverable was a **multi-faceted customer feedback survey**, covering aspects such as:

## 📋 Methodology

1. **Meetings with TAVO Founder (Tadas)**

5. **Analysis of Customer Responses & Product Recommendations**

## 🔍 Key Insights
